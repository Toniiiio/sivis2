- If not open a new issue and provide a minimal reproducible example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5963610/3502164. 

**sivis has potentially to cover hundreds of millions of webpages. While many of them might share a similar structure there are for sure thousands of exceptions and more. Therefore, we will have to prioritize for the cases that occur the most often. Therefore, please add as many examples as possible.**

Output of `sessionInfo()` and  browser version.
